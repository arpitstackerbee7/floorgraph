"""Per-workstation, per-day OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness).

Availability = Run Minutes / Planned Minutes
    Planned Minutes comes from `Workstation.total_working_hours` - a real,
    independently-configured shift calendar (`Workstation.working_hours`) -
    NOT derived from the same Downtime Log / Job Card Time Log activity
    that defines Run Minutes. Deriving it from activity would make
    Availability tautologically ~100% (planned time would always equal
    run time + downtime, by construction). If a Workstation has no
    working_hours configured, Availability is reported as 0, not 100 -
    an unconfigured shift calendar is a data gap, not evidence of perfect
    availability. Same for a holiday (per Workstation.holiday_list,
    honoring Manufacturing Settings.allow_production_on_holidays): Planned
    Minutes is 0, not a full shift's worth - otherwise a day the plant was
    closed, with nothing to log downtime against, reported 100%.

Performance = Ideal Run Minutes / Run Minutes
    Ideal Run Minutes = sum(ideal_cycle_time_per_unit * completed_qty)
    across Job Card Time Log rows for that workstation/day.
    ideal_cycle_time_per_unit comes from the Work Order Operation's
    time_in_mins / Work Order qty - real scheduling data already produced
    by ERPNext, not invented for this calculation.

Quality = Good Qty / Attempted Qty
    Bridges two different ERPNext schemas, not just one:

    - v15: Job Card has an explicit `scrap_items` child table (`Job Card
      Scrap Item`) - units that WERE completed but flagged defective on
      inspection. Attempted Qty == Actual Qty (everything scrapped was
      still "completed"); Good Qty = Actual Qty - Scrap Qty.
    - v16+: ERPNext removed `scrap_items` from Job Card entirely, replacing
      it with a single computed `process_loss_qty` field
      (for_quantity - total_completed_qty - pending_qty) - units that were
      NEVER completed at all, a yield-loss concept, not a post-completion
      defect flag. Those units are, by construction, absent from Actual
      Qty (the Job Card Time Log completed_qty sum), so Attempted Qty =
      Actual Qty + Process Loss Qty, and Good Qty = Actual Qty as-is.

    Both reduce to the same intent - Quality = fraction of attempted
    production that came out good - just from two structurally different
    signals depending on which ERPNext schema is installed. See
    `_job_card_scrap_qty` / `_job_card_process_loss_qty` for the schema
    detection.

    Job Card Scrap Item (v15) and process_loss_qty (v16+) both have no
    per-day granularity of their own (they're snapshots on the Job Card,
    not per-log-entry) - a job card's loss is attributed to the calendar
    date of its LAST time log that actually has completed_qty > 0 (not
    simply its last time log - a trailing zero-qty idle/travel entry must
    not "steal" the attribution date, since that day never has the job
    card in job_cards_seen and the loss would silently vanish rather than
    just being misattributed). That's a documented approximation for jobs
    spanning multiple days, not an exact daily slice. Loss qty and
    completed qty may also carry different UOMs in principle; no
    conversion is applied here.

OEE = Availability * Performance * Quality (all as 0-100 percentages,
scaled back down once).
